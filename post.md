## ðŸŽ‰ Announcing the Release of Laravel Zoho Cliq Package! ðŸš€

Iâ€™m excited to announce the release of the **Laravel Zoho Cliq** package, a powerful tool designed to bring seamless integration between Laravel applications and Zoho Cliq. Whether you're building a new app or enhancing an existing one, this package makes it incredibly easy to send messages, notifications, and rich content directly from your Laravel application to Zoho Cliq.

### Key Features:

- **Send Messages to Multiple Users**: Effortlessly broadcast messages to multiple Zoho Cliq users from your Laravel application.
- **Single User Messaging**: Send personalized messages to individual users with ease.
- **Rich Card Messaging**: Create visually engaging messages with interactive cards.
- **Channel Messaging**: Communicate with specific channels to keep your teams informed and engaged.

### How to Get Started

1. **Install the Package**: Add the Laravel Zoho Cliq package to your Laravel application using Composer:
   
   ```bash
   composer require realrashid/laravel-zoho-cliq
   ```

2. **Publish Configuration**: Publish the configuration file to set up your credentials:
   
   ```bash
   php artisan cliq:install
   ```

3. **Configure OAuth Credentials**: Obtain your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Zoho Cliqâ€™s API Console:
   
   - Visit [Zoho API Console](https://api-console.zoho.com/).
   - Click the **Get Started** button and select **Self Client**.
   - Click **Create**, then **OK** when prompted.
   - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, and add them to your `.env` file:
     
     ```dotenv
     CLIQ_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
     CLIQ_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
     CLIQ_DEFAULT_CHANNEL=your-default-channel
     CLIQ_DEFAULT_SEND_TO=buddies
     ```

### Example Usages

  ```php
  Route::get('/send-buddy-message', function () {
      $response = Cliq::to(['user1@example.com', 'user2@example.com'])
          ->send("Hello team! This is a message from Laravel.");

      return response()->json($response);
  });
  ```

              'https://example.com/image.jpg',
